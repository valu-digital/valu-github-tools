## Community Users

Although these are open source we are not resourced enough to properly support "community users" â€“ those not working for Valu Digital. You are free to use these helpers and even open issues here, but it is very likely that we don't have the time and resources to act on them. Same goes for PRs. Feel free to hard fork the repository and tweak it to your needs.
